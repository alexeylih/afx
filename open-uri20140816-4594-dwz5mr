In 2012, according to data compiled by the FBI, 410 Americans were “justifiably” killed by police—409 with guns. That figure may well be an underestimate. Not only is it limited to the number of people who were shot while committing a crime, but also, amazingly, reporting the data is voluntary.</p><p>Last year, in total, British police officers actually fired their weapons three times. The number of people fatally shot was zero. In 2012 the figure was just one. Even after adjusting for the smaller size of Britain’s population, British citizens are around 100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans. Between 2010 and 2014 the police force of one small American city, Albuquerque in New Mexico, shot and killed 23 civilians; seven times more...<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/armed-police?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

A new <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/8/1375.abstract">study</a> published in&nbsp;<em>Health Affairs </em>by Sam Harper and Jay Kaufman&nbsp;of McGill University and Richard MacLehose of the&nbsp;University of Minnesota has found that the gap in life&nbsp;expectancy between blacks and whites in America persists,&nbsp;despite policies aimed at closing it. (Other racial groups could not feature in the study because records concerning them were too scarce for the period scrutinised, according to Mr Harper.)</p><p>This is not to say there hasn’t been some progress over the years. Between 1990 and 2009 the difference in average life expectancy for black and white men narrowed from 8.1 to 5.4 years, and for women from 5.5 to 3.8 years. But some places made more headway than others.

This in turn means becoming familiar with a place that most politicians keep hidden—the undefined region where the chin becomes the neck. I don’t know of a good word in English for this place: Russian has <em>podbaradok</em>, which translates as “under the beard” and could be borrowed if beards were not so rare at the top level of American politics. In a whole day of speeches at the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of conservative Christians in Ames, Iowa on August 9th, the only person with any facial hair was Iowa’s governor, Terry Branstad, who has a neat moustache.</p><p dir="ltr">Processions of politicians giving stump speeches can prompt the mind to wander, partly because what is said is rarely original or changes anything very much. The exception to this norm is generally when a speaker challenges the assumptions of the audience and yet manages to win them over. Rick Santorum got closer to this than anyone else speaking inside the brutalist Stephens auditorium, which held the summit....<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/wooing-cultural-conservatives?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

This at least is the case put forward by Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley at the Brookings Institution in their book “<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2013/the-metropolitan-revolution" target="_blank">The Metropolitan Revolution</a>”, published last year. Local leaders have more real-world problems to contend with and more power to address them. They are also less hindered by political turf battles and relentless campaigns, so they are more likely to take on the kind of big challenges that daunt federal politicians. This means mayors and governors are busily working to kick-start their economies, invest in critical transportation infrastructure and reform education. They are also far more dynamic than the federal government in areas such as immigration, climate change and obesity.</p><p>Does this make local leaders less politically ideological? Anecdotally this seems to be the case.

House Republicans <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/boehner-about-protecting-constitution">have in mind</a>&nbsp;the president's penchant for revising enacted legislation by ad hoc&nbsp;decree, such as last year's decision&nbsp;to delay enforcement of Obamacare's employer mandate until 2015.

Primary elections begin in March and end in September, allowing reporters to travel the country eating barbecue with candidates for seven months. They attract relatively few voters (under 20% of those eligible turned up in 2010), meaning that well-organised lobby groups can hold disproportionate sway. Organised labour influences Democratic primaries more than ought to be the case given that only 11% of workers are union members. In Republican primaries, relatively small outfits like the Club for Growth, which campaigns for smaller government, can make a big splash because they need only sway a small number of people.</p><p>Sensing a problem, some states have tried to get more voters interested in primaries. One idea has been to open them up to members of either party, or none at all. Only 11 states now have primaries where Republicans pick Republicans and Democrats pick Democrats. California allows the two most popular candidates in the primary to run against each other in the general election, even if they are both from...<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/07/political-primaries?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

Compared with this, conservative proposals on tackling poverty can look thin.

In the 21st it is health care. Health spending comprised 17% of America’s GDP in 2012. About one in ten workers are employed in the health sector. These workers have the crucial job of making American health care more efficient, probably the country’s top domestic challenge. Those who are not doctors have a particularly important role—nurses and lesser-trained workers can monitor and care for patients out of hospital, which should result in better quality of life for patients and lower costs for everyone else. But just as the car industry was the 20th century’s main battleground for fights over labour, it is increasingly clear that health workers will be at the centre of the latest bitter conflict.</p><p>In the darkest days of the recession, health employment was a rare bright spot.
